# 🧠 Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition

This repository contains two neural network projects focused on recognizing handwritten digits using supervised learning. One targets **binary classification (0 vs 1)**, and the other handles **multiclass classification (0–9 digits)**.

---

## 🔍 Projects Included

### 1. Binary Classification: 0 vs 1

* ✅ Built a neural network using **TensorFlow** to classify between handwritten digits **0 and 1**
* 🧪 Implemented both **TensorFlow** and **NumPy-based** versions of the model for comparison
* 📊 Used sigmoid activation and binary cross-entropy loss for training
* 🔢 Evaluated model performance using accuracy and decision boundary visualization

### 2. Multiclass Classification: 0 to 9

* ✅ Developed a **multilayer neural network** for classifying digits from **0 to 9**
* 🔠 Applied **ReLU** activation in hidden layers and **Softmax** in the output layer
* 🧮 Used categorical cross-entropy loss with one-hot encoded labels
* 📈 Analyzed model predictions with visualizations and performance metrics
